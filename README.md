# Learn-Computer
Here, is an simple application which I made i.e Learn Computer which helps many beginners who dont know how to use computer 
a beginner can learn many new things out of this that includes how to "switch on the computer",how to start working on computer like creating a folder or file saving and deleting them.
the main part of this application is it teaches about all shortcut keys which are used in computer.
we can also practice what we have learn from this application.

# Computer Basics Tutorial Application üñ•Ô∏èüì±
A cross-platform application teaching fundamental computer skills through interactive lessons and hands-on practice sessions. Developed with **Python + Kivy**, this project demonstrates effective **AI-assisted development** through prompt engineering.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Multi-platform Support**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS
- **Modern UI**: Clean interface with Montserrat/Roboto fonts and adaptive themes
- **Interactive Learning**:
  - Step-by-step guided lessons
  - Real-time feedback practice sessions
  - File operations simulator (create/save/edit files)
- **AI-Generated Content**: Lesson content and code structure optimized via prompt engineering
- **Accessibility Focus**: Large touch targets, high-contrast modes, and screen-reader friendly components

## Technical Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

### AI-Assisted Development
- **Prompt-Engineered Architecture**: Used ChatGPT/GPT-4 to:
  - Generate initial code scaffolding
  - Solve cross-platform compatibility issues
  - Optimize UI layouts for mobile/desktop
- **Iterative Refinement**:
  - 50+ refined prompts to produce production-ready code
  - AI-generated documentation and comments
- **Human-AI Workflow**:
  ```python
  # Example: Prompt-generated practice session logic
  def check_practice_step(self, action):
      """AI-optimized function to validate user actions"""
      if action == 'save' and not self.practice_file_path:
          return self.show_save_dialog()  # AI-suggested flow control
